# JWT_User_Authentication_-React-NodeJS-MySQL-


## ðŸ“˜ About This Repository
In this repository, Iâ€™ve documented my learning experience and built a User Authentication Project using:

1. React for the frontend
2. Node.js for the backend
3. MySQL as the database for storing user data

Through this project, I learned how to implement secure user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and showcased it with a clean, modern UI built in React.

Iâ€™m happy to contribute this project on GitHub to help fellow developers understand the important concepts of user authentication.

Thank you for visiting my repository! ðŸ˜Š
