========================== JWT User Authentication using React, NodeJs, and MySQL ==================================

1️⃣ What is Authentication?
📌 Authentication is the process of verifying who you are. It ensures that users provide valid credentials (like email & password) to access an application.
🔹 Example: When you log into a website (e.g., Gmail), you enter your email & password. If correct, you get access. Otherwise, you’re denied.


2️⃣ Why Do We Need Authentication?
✅ Security: Protects user data from unauthorized access
✅ User Identity: Helps apps recognize different users
✅ Personalization: Users get their own customized experience


3️⃣ How Does Authentication Work?
The authentication process follows these steps:
1️⃣ User Registration (Sign Up)
The user enters their email & password.
The password is hashed (encrypted) for security.
The data is stored in the MySQL database.
2️⃣ User Login
The user enters their email & password.
The system checks the database for matching credentials.
If valid, a JWT (JSON Web Token) is generated & sent to the frontend.
3️⃣ Protected Routes (Optional but Important!)
Some pages should be restricted (e.g., dashboard).
If a user is logged in (valid token), they can access protected pages.

4️⃣ Step-by-Step Implementation
✅ Register Page (Sign Up)
✅ Login Page
✅ Modern UI with React & React Router
✅ Backend with Node.js & Express
✅ Database with MySQL
✅ Password Hashing (for security) using bcrypt
✅ JWT Token for secure login sessions

🔹 Step 1: Setup the Project
1️⃣ Install MySQL & Create Database
install MySQL
Create database
Create user table

🔹 Step 2: Setup Backend (Node.js + Express)
1️⃣ Initialize Node.js
Create a folder for the backend: ====>     mkdir backend && cd backend
Initialize a Node.js project: ====>     npm init -y
2️⃣ Install Required Packages
        npm install express mysql2 cors dotenv bcryptjs jsonwebtoken

🔹 Step 3: Create Backend Code
1. setup express server
2. register API 
3. login API

🔹 Step 4: Setup Frontend (React)
create react project 
        npx create-react-app frontend
        cd frontend
1️⃣ Install Required Packages
        npm install axios react-router-dom
2️⃣ Create Pages in React
        login page and register page
3️⃣ Add routing (react router)


🔹 Step 5: Protected Route 

🔹 Step 6: Make UI Modern
